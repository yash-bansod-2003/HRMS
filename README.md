# HRMS - Human Resource Management System

A modern, full-stack Human Resource Management System built with Django REST Framework and React. This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee records and tracking attendance.

Note: Hey, I want to just apologize for the thing I didn't get enough time to spend on the project due to busy schedule and so many things are going on. I hope you can understand I am unable to add the functionalities inside the application but I tried whatever I can. I focused more on the core architecture things and minimal but yes I can do more with dedicated time for like I am not able to concentrate on the project properly.

# Resources

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: 3.13
- **Node.js**: 24
- **Git**: Latest version

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-bansod-2003/HRMS.git
cd HRMS
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Step 1: Navigate to backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

#### Step 2: Create virtual environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=<Postgres Database URL>
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

#### Step 5: Run migrations

```bash
python manage.py loaddata employees attendance
```

#### Step 7: Create superuser (optional)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Step 8: Run development server

```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal window:

#### Step 1: Navigate to frontend directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash

```

#### Step 3: Configure environment (optional)

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory if you need to customize the API URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Step 4: Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

## Usage

Note: The home page and update are not implemented. To be frank, I am not getting the time I required for the project due to busy schedule so whatever I can done in between I complete and just provided the link. I hope you can understand the project is CI/CD loaded so if you really want the changes just let me know I will finish them.

2. **Employee Management**:
   - Navigate to the Employees page
   - Click "Add Employee" to create new employee records
   - Use the data table to view, edit, or delete employees
   - Filter and sort employees by various fields

   - Navigate to the Attendance page
   - Mark attendance for employees
   - View attendance records with filtering options

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The project includes Dockerfiles for production deployment:

# Backend
docker build -f backend/docker/production/Dockerfile -t hrms-backend .

# Frontend
docker build -f frontend/docker/production/Dockerfile -t hrms-frontend .
```

## 📝 Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

1. **Database**: SQLite is used for development; production should use PostgreSQL
2. **Authentication**: Currently uses Django session authentication; JWT can be implemented for production
3. **Departments**: Limited to three departments (HR, IT, Sales) - can be extended to a separate model
4. **Attendance Status**: Binary status (Present/Absent) - can be extended for half-day, late, etc.
5. **Time Zone**: Uses server's default timezone for date handling

### Limitations

1. **User Authentication**: No multi-user authentication system implemented in the current version
2. **Role-based Access**: No granular permissions (HR admin, manager, employee roles)
3. **Email Notifications**: No automated email notifications for attendance or employee updates
4. **Reports**: No built-in reporting or analytics dashboard
5. **File Uploads**: No support for employee documents or profile pictures
6. **Audit Trail**: No comprehensive logging of changes to records
7. **Mobile App**: No native mobile application (responsive web only)
8. **Search**: Basic filtering available; advanced search not implemented

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- JWT authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Employee document management
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Leave management system
- Payroll integration
- Email notifications
- Audit logging
- Export data to Excel/PDF
- Advanced search and filters
- Real-time notifications
